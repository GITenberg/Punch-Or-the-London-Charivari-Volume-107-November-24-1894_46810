<h2>"THE FOURTH R."</h2>

<p>'Twas "The Three R's" they promised us, but now They're merged in a bad
fourth&mdash;Religious (?) Row!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>["The so-called 'compromise' of 1871 was based on the assumption that,
when all the differences of our English Christendom were struck out,
there would be found the beating heart of 'a common Christianity'
sending a quickening life through all its members.... Believing it not
impossible for 'all who profess and call themselves Christians' to
reconcile themselves to these two forms, elementary and supplementary, I
earnestly commend them for peaceful co-existence to the conflicting
parties of School Board electors and members."&mdash;<i>Dr. James
Martineau's Letter to the "Times" of November 14.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O wise and gentle teacher, whose appeal<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is to the common heart, whilst general anger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Distracts and darkens all our commonweal,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And schools and churches ring with noisy clangour;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would they but heed thy loving call, though late,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How would the prospect brighten! Zeal fanatic<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With disingenuous dodges of debate,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Insidious cant, assumption autocratic,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secular spleen, short-sighted super-thrift,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All are at furious odds, wild-warring, windy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Intent, 'twould seem, to whelm a glorious gift<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the loud whirlpool of sectarian shindy!<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The beating heart"? It seems a mingled maze<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of beating hands, and bludgeons wildly waving.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How send "a quickening life" through this dull craze<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of deadly, deadening rancour rudely raving?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What <i>is</i> their task, these teachers of the untaught,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">These would-be lighteners of our mental blindness?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is the lesson the child-crowds have caught<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From these tumultuous foes of human-kindness?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They told us, in quaint diction, the Three R's<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Should renovate the land, refine the people;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Break down at last low-birth's invidious bars.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Alas! What rings from school-tower and church-steeple?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not the harmonious heaven-aspiring sound<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of blessing-bearing bells, but furious clashing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of cracked creed-tocsins, spreading wrath around,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Love's efforts thwarting, wisdom's high hopes dashing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where be the "Three R's" now? Sectarian schism<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Has cloven up the compromise, and ended<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Ugly Rush! See rampant Rileyism<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shaking its standard at the door, attended<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close by the Nonconformist banner-bearer,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Religion without Dogma!" blazoned boldly,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Denouncing the first "R" as child-ensnarer<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Into a fold whereon <i>his</i> creed looks coldly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst hating hotly one who hotly hates<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His shibboleth as vague and vain and vapid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next, vigorous be-rater of the Rates,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whose rise he vows is ruinously rapid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unsympathetic Gallio of the Shop<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pence-saving soul and strenuous till-protector,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The third R rages.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Stop, mad zealots, stop!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lest all the toil of Board and School Inspector,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Teacher and taught, end in one fourth R&mdash;ROW!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A vulgar term, my masters, unscholastic;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But&mdash;the great lesson ye are teaching <i>now</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the young mind, and to the conscience plastic,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of gutter-waifs and children of the slum.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They have "long ears," <i>these</i> "little pitchers," verily.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think you without joint bidding they will come<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whom their old teacher, Vice, employs so merrily?<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>His</i> creed is one, <i>his</i> doctrine's not obscure,<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>His</i> tests and formularies do not vary,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>His</i> "standards" stand, and his "results" are sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And of "school-places" <i>he</i> is never chary.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh self-elected shepherds, with your crooks,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fighting, while round your folds the wolves are creeping!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pedagogues wrangling o'er your lesson-books,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whilst your wrath rages human love sits weeping!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If of "a common Christianity"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ye were but practical and patient teachers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Education's task ye might <i>agree</i>.<br /></span>

<p class="center">PART XXI.&mdash;THE FEELINGS OF A MOTHER.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Scene XXXI.</span>&mdash;<i>The Morning Room.</i> <span class="smcap">Time</span>&mdash;<i>Sunday morning;
just after breakfast.</i></p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>outside, to</i> <span class="smcap">Tredwell</span>). Dogcart round, eh?
everything in? All right&mdash;shan't be a minute. (<i>Entering.</i>) Hallo,
<span class="smcap">Pilliner</span>, you all alone here? (<i>He looks round disconcertedly.</i>)
Don't happen to have seen Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span> about?</p>

<p><i>Pilliner.</i> Let me see&mdash;she <i>was</i> here a little while ago, I fancy....
Why? Do you want her?</p>

<p><i>Capt. Thick.</i> No&mdash;only to say good-bye and that. I'm just off.</p>

<p><i>Pill.</i> Off? To-day! You don't mean to tell me your chief is
such an inconsiderate old ruffian as to expect you to travel back to
your <span class="smcap">Tommies</span> on the Sabbath! You could wait till to-morrow if
you <i>wanted</i> to. Come now!</p>

<p><i>Capt. Thick.</i> Perhaps&mdash;only, you see, I <i>don't</i> want to.</p>

<p><i>Pill.</i> Well, tastes differ. A cross-country
journey in a slow train, with unlimited opportunities
of studying the Company's bye-laws
and traffic arrangements at several admirably
ventilated junctions, is not my own idea of the
best way to spend a cheery Sunday, that's all.</p>

<p><i>Capt. Thick.</i> (<i>gloomily</i>). Daresay it will be
about as cheery as stoppin' on here, if it comes
to that.</p>

<p><i>Pill.</i> I admit we were most of us a wee bit
chippy at breakfast. The Bard conversed&mdash;but
he seemed to diffuse a gloom somehow. Shut
you up once or twice in a manner that might
almost be described as d&mdash;d offensive.</p>

<p><i>Capt. Thick.</i> Don't know what you all saw
in what he said that was so amusin'. Confounded
rude <i>I</i> thought it!</p>

<p><i>Pill.</i> Don't think anyone <i>was</i> amused&mdash;unless
it was Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>. By the way, he might
perhaps have selected a happier topic to hold
forth to Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span> on than the scandalous
indifference of large landowners to the condition
of the rural labourer. Poor dear old boy,
he stood it wonderfully, considering. Pity the
Countess breakfasted upstairs; she'd have enjoyed
herself. However, he had a very good
audience in little Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>.</p>

<p><i>Capt. Thick.</i> I do hate a chap that jaws at
breakfast.... <i>Where</i> did you say she was?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie's voice</i> (<i>outside, in Conservatory</i>).
Yes, you really ought to see the Orangery
and the Elizabethan Garden, Mr. <span class="smcap">Blair</span>. If
you will be on the terrace in about five minutes,
I could take you round myself. I must go and
see if I can get the keys first.</p>

<p><i>Pill.</i> If you want to say good-bye, old fellow,
now's your chance!</p>

<p><i>Capt. Thick.</i> It&mdash;it don't matter. She's
engaged. And, look here, you needn't mention
that I was askin' for her.</p>

<p><i>Pill.</i> Of course, old fellow, if you'd rather
not. (<i>He glances at him.</i>) But I say, my
dear old chap, if <i>that</i>'s how it is with you, I
don't quite see the sense of chucking it up
<i>already</i>, don't you know. No earthly affair of
mine, I know; still, if I <i>could</i> manage to stay on, I would, if I
were <i>you</i>.</p>

<p><i>Capt. Thick.</i> Hang it all, <span class="smcap">Pilliner</span>, do you suppose <i>I</i> don't know
when the game's up! If it was any <i>good</i> stayin' on&mdash;&mdash; And besides,
I've said good-bye to Lady C., and all that. No, it's too late now.</p>

<p><i>Tredwell</i> (<i>at the door</i>). Excuse me, Sir, but if you're going by
the 10.40, you haven't any too much time.</p>

<p><i>Pill.</i> (<i>to himself, after</i> Captain <span class="smcap">Thicknesse</span> <i>has hurried out</i>). Poor
old chap, he does seem hard hit! Pity he's not Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie's</span>
sort. Though what she can see in that long-haired beggar&mdash;&mdash;!
Wonder when <span class="smcap">Vivian Spelwane</span> intends to come down; never
knew her miss breakfast before.... What's that rustling?...
Women! I'll be off, or they'll nail me for church before I know it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">[<i>He disappears hastily in the direction of the Smoking Room
as</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Cantire</span> and Mrs. <span class="smcap">Chatteris</span> <i>enter</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> Nonsense, my dear, no walk at all; the church is
only just across the park. My brother <span class="smcap">Rupert</span> always goes, and it
pleases him to see the Wyvern pew as full as possible. I seldom feel
equal to going myself, because I find the necessity of allowing pulpit
inaccuracy to pass without a protest gets too much on my nerves;
but my daughter will accompany you. You'll have just time to run
up and get your things on.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Chatteris</i> (<i>with arch significance</i>). I don't <i>fancy</i> I shall have
the pleasure of your daughter's society this morning. I just met her
going to get the garden keys; I think she has promised to show the
grounds to&mdash;&mdash;Well, I needn't mention <i>whom</i>. Oh dear me, I
hope I'm not being indiscreet <i>again!</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> I make a point of never interfering with my
daughter's proceedings, and you can easily understand how natural
it is that such old friends as they have always been&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Chatt.</i> Really? I <i>thought</i> they seemed to take a great
pleasure in one another's society. It's quite romantic. But I must
rush up and get my bonnet on if I'm to go to church. (<i>To herself,
as she goes out.</i>) So she <i>was</i> "Lady Grisoline," after all! If I was
her mother&mdash;&mdash; But dear Lady <span class="smcap">Cantire</span> is so advanced about
things.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> (<i>to herself</i>). Darling <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>! He'll be Lord <span class="smcap">Dunderhead</span>
before very long. How sensible and sweet of her! And
I was quite uneasy about them last night at dinner; they scarcely
seemed to be talking to each other at all. But there's a great deal
more in dear <span class="smcap">Maisie</span> than one would imagine.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert</i> (<i>outside</i>). We're rather proud of
our church, Mr. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>&mdash;fine old monuments
and brasses, if you care about that sort
of thing. Some of us will be walking over to
service presently, if you would like to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>outside&mdash;to himself</i>). And lose
my <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> with Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>! Not exactly!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) I am afraid, Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>, that I cannot
conscientiously&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> (<i>hastily</i>). Oh, very well, very well;
do exactly as you like about it, of course. I
only thought&mdash;&mdash;(<i>To himself.</i>) Now that
<i>other</i> young chap would have gone!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>, who is that you are
talking to out there? I don't recognise his
voice, somehow.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> (<i>entering with</i> <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>). Ha,
<span class="smcap">Rohesia</span>, you've come down, then? slept well,
I hope. I was talking to a gentleman whose
acquaintance I know you will be very happy to
make&mdash;at last. This is the genuine celebrity
<i>this</i> time. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>.) Let me make
you known to my sister, Lady <span class="smcap">Cantire</span>, Mr.
<span class="smcap">Undershell</span>. (<i>As</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Cantire</span> <i>glares interrogatively.</i>)
Mr. <span class="smcap">Clarion Blair</span>, <span class="smcap">Rohesia</span>,
author of hum&mdash;ha&mdash;<i>Andromache</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> I thought we were given to
understand last night that Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>&mdash;Mr.
<span class="smcap">Blair</span>&mdash;you must pardon me, but it's really so
very confusing&mdash;that the writer of the&mdash;ah&mdash;volume
in question had already left Wyvern.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> Well, my dear, you see he is still
here&mdash;er&mdash;fortunately for us. If you'll excuse
me, I'll leave Mr. <span class="smcap">Blair</span> to entertain you; got
to speak to <span class="smcap">Tredwell</span> about something.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">[<i>He hurries out.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). This must be Lady
<span class="smcap">Maisie's</span> mamma. Better be civil to her, I
suppose, but I can't stay here and entertain
her long! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Lady <span class="smcap">Cantire</span>, I&mdash;er&mdash;have
an appointment for which I am already a
little late; but before I go, I should like to tell
you how much pleasure it has given me to know
that my poor verse has won your approval;
appreciation from&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> I'm afraid you must have been misinformed, Mr.&mdash;a&mdash;<span class="smcap">Blair</span>.
There are so many serious publications claiming attention
in these days of literary over-production that I have long made it a
rule to read no literature of a lighter order that has not been before
the world for at least ten years. I may be mistaken, but I infer
from your appearance that your own work must be of a considerably
more recent date.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). If she imagines she's going to snub Me&mdash;&mdash;!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) Then I was evidently mistaken in gathering from some expressions
in your daughter's letter that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> Entirely. You are probably thinking of some totally
different person, as my daughter has never mentioned having written
to you, and is not in the habit of conducting <i>any</i> correspondence
without my full knowledge and approval. I think you said you had
some appointment; if so, pray don't consider yourself under any
necessity to remain.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> You are very good; I will not. (<i>To himself, as he retires.</i>)
Awful old lady, that! I quite thought she would know all about that
letter, or I should never have&mdash;&mdash;However, I said nothing to compromise
anyone, luckily!</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin</i> (<i>entering</i>). Good morning, <span class="smcap">Rohesia</span>. So glad you felt
equal to coming down. I was almost afraid&mdash;after <i>last night</i>, you know.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span></p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> (<i>offering a cold cheekbone for salutation</i>). I am in my
usual health, thank you, <span class="smcap">Albinia</span>. As to last night, if you <i>must</i> ask
a literary Socialist down here, you might at least see that he is
received with common courtesy. You may, for anything <i>you</i> can tell,
have advanced the Social Revolution ten years in a single evening!</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> My <i>dear</i> <span class="smcap">Rohesia</span>! If you remember, it was you
yourself who&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> (<i>closing her eyes</i>). I am in no condition to <i>argue</i> about
it, <span class="smcap">Albinia</span>. The slightest exercise of your own common sense would
have shown you&mdash;&mdash;But there, no great harm has been done, fortunately,
so let us say no more about it. I have something more
agreeable to talk about. I've every reason to hope that <span class="smcap">Maisie</span> and
dear <span class="smcap">Gerald Thicknesse</span>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> (<i>astonished</i>). <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>? But I thought <span class="smcap">Gerald
Thicknesse</span> spoke as if&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> Very possibly, my dear. I have always refrained from
giving him any encouragement, and I wouldn't put any pressure
upon dear <span class="smcap">Maisie</span> for the world&mdash;still, I have my feelings as a mother,
and I can't deny that, with such prospects as he has now, it <i>is</i> gratifying
for me to think that they may be coming to an understanding
together at this very moment; she is showing him the grounds;
which I always think are the great charm of Wyvern, so <i>secluded!</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> (<i>puzzled</i>). Together! At this very moment! But&mdash;but
surely <span class="smcap">Gerald</span> has <i>gone?</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> Gone! What nonsense, <span class="smcap">Albinia</span>! Where in the
world should he have gone to?</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> He <i>was</i> leaving by the 10.40, I know. For Aldershot.
I ordered the cart for him, and he said good-bye after breakfast.
He seemed so dreadfully down, poor fellow, that I quite fancied from
what he said that <span class="smcap">Maisie</span> must have&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> Impossible, my dear, quite impossible! I tell you he
is <i>here</i>. Why, only a few minutes ago, Mrs. <span class="smcap">Chatteris</span> was telling
me&mdash;&mdash; Ah, here she is to speak for herself. (<i>To</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Chatteris</span>, <i>who
appears, arrayed for public service</i>.) Mrs. <span class="smcap">Chatteris</span>, did I, or did
I <i>not</i>, understand you to say just now that my daughter <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Chatt.</i> (<i>alarmed</i>). But, <i>dear</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Cantire</span>, I had no idea
you would disapprove. Indeed you seemed&mdash;&mdash;And really, though
she certainly takes an interest in him, I'm sure&mdash;<i>almost</i> sure&mdash;there
can be nothing serious&mdash;at present.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> Thank you, my dear, I merely wished for an answer
to my question. And you see, <span class="smcap">Albinia</span>, that <span class="smcap">Gerald Thicknesse</span>
can hardly have gone yet, since he is walking about the grounds with
<span class="smcap">Maisie</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Chatt.</i> Captain <span class="smcap">Thicknesse</span>? But he <i>has</i> gone, Lady <span class="smcap">Cantire</span>!
I saw him start. I didn't mean <i>him</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> Indeed? then I shall be obliged if you will say who it
is you <i>did</i> mean.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Chatt.</i> Why, only her old friend and admirer&mdash;that little
poet man, Mr. <span class="smcap">Blair</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> (<i>to herself</i>). And I actually <i>sent</i> him to her! (<i>Rising
in majestic wrath.</i>) <span class="smcap">Albinia</span>, whatever comes of this, remember I
shall hold <i>you</i> entirely responsible!</p>

<h2>THE WHIMS OF AMPHITRYON.</h2>

<p>Isn't our good friend of the <i>P. M. G.</i> a little extravagant with his
culinary raptures? However, we will not be outdone. If he rhapsodises
the "Magnificent Mushroom," we have discovered a still more
exalting theme, which, taking "whelk" as pronounced, we will call</p>

<h3>THE WITCHERY OF THE WHELK.</h3>

<p>Would you learn the divinest glory of a goddess among molluscs?
Would you note the gastronomic charms of a succulent sea-nymph?
Ostracise, then, from your table the blue-point impostor that foists
his bearded banality on the faithful elect. Let the cult of that lusty
Titan, the Limpet, sink awhile into the limbo of outworn idolatries.
Forbear, if you are wise, to hymn the stern masculinity of the Mussel,
gregarious demi-god but taciturn, hermetically sealed within the
wilful valves of a sulky self-effacement. And let that other fakir of
the sea-marge, the fantastic and Pharisaic Scallop, ply his Eleusinian
rites, unrevered by the devout and metaphor-mixing epicure.
Rather let it be ours to celebrate, though baldest prose were all-insufficient,
the allurements of a pandemic Aphrodite, the seductive
Whitechapel Whelk, and the coy grace of her sister, the wanton
Winkle of Rosherville.</p>

<p>Let us take the first&mdash;assume that the siren is yours, then
consider how fitliest she shall be dressed. And here it shall be seen
whether you have true chivalry and romance in your soul, or
whether you grovel in mere sensual <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gourmandise</i>. What says
Master <span class="smcap">Bill Nupkins</span>, master-cook to the Blue Pig chop-house in
Skittle-alley? Is there not an idyllic flavour of Cocaigne, a very
fervour of simplicity about his spelling which goes straight to the
gizzard of the whelk-worshipper? Listen to his wise counsel on
whelks <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à la</i> Shoreditch:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tyke three 'aputh of whilks, 'Erne By sort fer choice, and
chuck 'em wiv a saveloy and a kipper into a sorcepan, if you can
nick one from a juggins. Bile 'em till they're green, and add 'arf a
glorss of unsweetened, tho it's a pity to wyste it. If toimes is 'ard,
the kids and the missus can 'ave the rinsings, or go wivout. Taike
my tip, and don't you be a bloomin' mug. You can blyme well
stick to the juggins' sorcepan. You may, I dessay, raise arf a
dollar on it." There speaks the true <i>gourmet</i>, with single-hearted
straight-forward egotism, worthy of a City alderman, in all the
glory of a civic banquet. To none but an artist in guttlery would
that touch of genius about the kids and the missus occur.</p>

<p>Again, disdain not the sweetly subtle recipes and romantic fancies
that you may gather during your sojourn at Colney Hatch. For there,
far from the dull Philistinism of house-dinners and fried-fish shops,
with all wild Mænad orgies may your divinity be adored. Learn but
one magic formula, and you shall see the wizard-working of your
incantation, as, like an enchantress herself bewitched, she assumes
you an ensorceled, faery shape. Here, mark you, is this potent
spell, culled from the inspired lips of a frenzied <i>chef</i>.</p>

<p><i>To Make Whelk Fritters.</i>&mdash;Take one ripe whelk, draw and truss
it until you are black in the face, tie up the forequarter with chickweed,
sit down, and smoke a pipe; parboil anything you like for a
few hours, or don't, if you don't care to; rub the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">purée</i> through a
tammy (I don't know what this is); flavour with elbow-grease, egg-<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">faisandé</i>,
mud-salad, and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bêtes noire</i>; dredge the gallimaufrey, and
hold your nose; write some letters; the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vol-au-vent</i> will then
explode; wrap the pieces in an old sock, and bury for six weeks;
take the 2.13 train to town, and have your hair cut, or pay some
calls; then start again with another whelk, and proceed as before;
but it is better to buy the fritters ready-made."</p>

<p>Is not this a lesson in devotion and perseverance? Rejoice greatly,
and work out your sybaritic salvation.</p>

<p>And now that you have food for pious reflection, after a space you
shall, to your exceeding great advantage, be further instructed in the
liturgy of the Winkle.</p>

<span class="i2">That my foes might call omnivorous voracity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it is a noble hunger; on nobility I doat;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And black baa-lambs are so given to&mdash;pugnacity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So full of ill-will, too, in all circumstances! Yes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They turn nasty at the thought of being eaten up!<br /></span>

<h2>QUEER QUERIES.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The L. C. C. Again.</span>&mdash;Is it possible that the Government is about to
back up the London County Council in another attack on one of our
time-hallowed institutions? I see that Mr. <span class="smcap">Asquith</span> told a deputation
that "one of the first acts of a Local Authority, if it had the
power, would be to abolish the Ring." What on earth has a Local
Authority to do with the mode in which marriages are celebrated?
Englishmen should rise in their thousands to defend the wedding-ring,
symbolising as it does the sanctity of the nuptial tie, and should
hurl from power a Government which is about to hand us over,
fingers and souls, to a tyrannical set of County Council busybodies.
Mr. <span class="smcap">Asquith</span> went on to talk rather disconnectedly, it seems to me,
about gambling; perhaps he holds the cheap modern view that
"Marriage is a Lottery." But I want to know why a Home Secretary
meddles with subjects of this sort? And how long is this conspiracy
between a Radical Ministry and the L. C. C. to be allowed to continue?</p>

<h2>MORE SHE-NOTES.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By</i> <span class="smcap">I&#333;pna</span>, <i>Author of "A Yellow Plaster."</i>)</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chapter I.</span></h3>

<p>"<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Virginibus puerisque</i>," said Miss <span class="smcap">Constantia Demning</span>; "and it's by a
<i>man!</i>"</p>

<p>"By a <i>man!</i>" echoed the awe-struck <span class="smcap">Athanasia</span>.</p>

<p>"And to think that in spite of all our pioneering and efforts to confine
her studies to the New Woman Series our niece may even now have tasted
of the tree and be bursting out into throbbing nerve-centres and
palpable possibilities. Compare we two with her! Have you noted her
restless craving after Philistine delights such as man-worship and a
literary style? Thank Heaven, she never got that from <i>us</i> or <i>our</i>
books."</p>

<p>The speakers were a pair of old Purgatorial Twins, not without
alleviations, designed by Nature to multiply. But aloofness, coupled in
harness with anæmia, had nipped the wilding shoots in the bud and won
hands down at the distance. True, in the scraggy past, there had been a
male creature, less curate than Cupid, that each of them had saved her
soul alive in the memory of. But the cares of celibacy, cruel-heavy as a
portmanteau-metaphor, now weighed on their shoulders; they could not
crush them with a burial-spade like complete natures; they stamped their
faces (the cares did the twins' faces) with their ponderous crow's feet.</p>

<p>Still, at times, like spring-cleanings, came spring-hankerings. A whiff
of yellow tulip on the breeze, and they would drink in the sunlight and
the flowers and the beasts and the fishes and the dew and the early
worm.</p>

<p>Even now as they peered into this book of forbidden sentiment at the
words&mdash;"The presence of the two lovers is so enchanting to each other
that it seems it must be the best thing possible for everybody
else"&mdash;from some faded, twilit cellar of the past came the bleating
lyre-bird of carnal reverie; but the astuter of the two scented tangibly
the cloven hoof, and coming to her better self with a strangled "Oh!"
she cast the book into the stove of the Queen Anne parlour, so
suggestive of their own aloofness, void as it was of dog or waste-paper
basket, or English grammar, or any such humanizing influence.</p>

<p>At that moment a pair of swift, Pagan feet sounded in the passage.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chapter II.</span></h3>

<p>When <span class="smcap">Margerine</span> entered there was the usual family
aloofness in her face, but also a new element of alleviation.
Always plastic as the compound from which she
derived her name she had now reached five feet seven
and a half inches, and from the crest of her unutterably
pullulating womanhood could afford to look down impersonally
on her maiden aunts as they struggled in the
trough like square pegs in a round hole.</p>

<p>The spectacle of burning leather was in her nostrils, and the vile smell
of it gave her an insight into the situation. Plunging her Aunt's best
silver-plated sugar-tongs into the flames, she rescued her shrivelled
treasure, waved it above the coming tempest like a brand, and faced
them, rigid with wrath, half-seas-over with the glamour of things.</p>

<p>An odd, earnest, ineffable look jumped into her eyes, changing their
grey to pitch-black, with patches of ethereal blue, where the soul shone
through. To their dying day the twins never forgot the smell, or ceased
from the pain of their incapacity to grasp the fresh, unmellowed point
of view. Points of view are the very dickens.</p>

<p>At last she got less rigid, and became nasty in soft, sweet, labial
gutturals, like the whoop of a bull-frog on the sleepy pool just above
the dam.</p>

<p>"Is this well-born and well-bred in you, I ask?" There was a defiant
abasement in her tone. "Of course you can't help it. You never loved!
Pooh!"</p>

<p>The two elder Miss <span class="smcap">Demnings</span> crushed the fledgling secret of the late
curate into its nest, and vituperated till they fell short of matter,
being but poorly winded.
"Unregenerate&mdash;abandoned&mdash;viper&mdash;alleviator! Pass from
our twin presence!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margerine</span> moved toward the door; then, by a quaint habit that was a
third nature to her (she had two others), she stood there absently, ajar
and aloof. Her air of distinction came right out through her wretched
frock. Then she went to the drawing-room, singeing her Pagan cheek with
the smouldering volume, her young, expansive brain hot with the thought
that there were no other copies in the village. "Unless he sends for
another from town I shall never be able to keep up my unreasoning,
palpitating ecstasy. I must have some ventilation for my inevitableness,
or burst."</p>

<p>She rang for fresh tea. The crumpets were crystal-cold. She tasted one,
and had a qualm, as if her sympathies were getting enlarged. For a
moment she wondered what a headache such as she had read about in books
could be like. The next, she was down by the trout-stream, familiar in
all she-notes, and lay there gurgling with gutturals.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of <span class="smcap">Chamois Hyde</span> was that he could not bear making other
people&mdash;college dons, for instance&mdash;ridiculous. About himself
it did not so much matter. Oxford had succeeded Eton, and hard on the
heels of a good degree had come a cropper in the hunting-field, a nurse,
a complicated kiss, a proposal, marriage, disillusionment, in the order
named. A poorer, singler man, with the same prancing tip-toe spirit,
would have lost all sense of decency, and written a book. But being
rich, and, by profession, married, he also was on his way to the usual
trout-stream. Which was a thousand pities, and comes into the next
chapter.</p>

<h2>THE CHRONICLES OF A RURAL PARISH.</h2>

<h3>II.&mdash;THE PUBLIC MEETING.</h3>

<p>I promised last week that the third chapter
should be devoted to my meeting, and a <span class="smcap">Winkins's</span>
word is as good as his bond, in point of
fact, if anything a trifle better. But I think I
ought first to mention that since the account of
my interview with Mrs. <span class="smcap">Letham Havitt</span> and
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Arble March</span> appeared in print, I have
been subjected to the annoyance of receiving an
anonymous letter. I should be the last to suggest
that either of these ladies, for whom my admiration
is equalled only by my respectful awe, had
anything to do with this missive, but here is what
it contained. "It is easy to jeer at Woman, but
be warned in time. Her day will come. Already,
married or single, she may vote, already County
Councils tremble at her word. Treat Woman
with respect, <i>or it will be the worse for you</i>."
These last words were written in red ink. I confess
I'm not easily frightened, but I don't like
this kind of thing. And all my wife says is that
it serves me right for getting mixed up in these
public affairs at my time of life, and that I ought
to know better.</p>

<p>"You're not fitted for it, <span class="smcap">Timothy</span>," she says, "and you'll only be made
a fool for your pains." I am very fond of my wife, but I wished she
wasn't a prophetess.</p>

<p>It is time to come to the meeting. It was held in the Voluntary
Schoolroom, granted to me by the Vicar, on the express condition that I
should be strictly non-political. The room was crammed with persons, men
and women, married and single. The Vicar brought his daughters, two
charming girls. <span class="smcap">Black Bob</span> and his mates were there, in solid rows,
whilst Mrs. <span class="smcap">Havitt</span> and Mrs. <span class="smcap">March</span> both turned up, attended by
body-guards&mdash;the one of Women Liberals, the other of Primrose
Leaguers. When the Chairman rose at half-past seven it is no
exaggeration to say that the scene was striking and impressive. Then,
two minutes later, I rose, and commenced my <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">magnum opus</i> of oratory. I
had fifty-two pages of notes, I drank six glasses of water, and
twenty-three people left before I had done, which was not until an hour
and five minutes had elapsed. I don't for a moment complain that
twenty-three left; my complaint is that the number was so few. My
peroration, to which I had devoted days of care, somehow hardly had the
effect I had hoped for.</p>

<p>"This is indeed a memorable year," I said; "a year of truly rural
significance. It remains with you to show that you are prepared to rise
to the height of the occasion. If you do this, if you grasp firmly the
benefits which this Act offers you, then when next New Year's Day the
gladsome bells ring out once again to tell a listening world that one
year is dead and that another lives, they will sound all the clearer,
all the more joyous, because they ring in a year in which Mudford will
have a Parish Council."</p>

<p>Then I sat down, amidst subdued applause, which, I admit, disappointed
me. The Vicar's daughters never even took the trouble to applaud at all,
and both seemed to have something to confide to their handkerchiefs.
Black <span class="smcap">Bob</span> whispered to his neighbour, "Laying it on thick to-night,
isn't he?" I wonder what he meant.</p>

<p>After this commenced a torrent of questions, forty-six in all before
they were done. May I never live to have such another experience! All
the points I had evaded, because I had not understood them, came up with
hardly a single exception. One man asked, "Can the Parish Council remove
the parson?"&mdash;a most embarrassing question, which evoked roars of
laughter from the audience, and a look of indignation from the Vicar.
And the awful conundrums!&mdash;most of which I had to content myself
with giving up. Here is one. "Supposing only eight people come to the
Parish Meeting, and a Parish Council of seven has to be elected, and
suppose seven of the eight are nominated for election, and the seven are
elected chairmen of the Meeting in succession, and have all to retire
because they are candidates for the Council, and suppose the eighth man
cannot read or write, and when he's proposed as chairman, goes home, how
will the Parish Council be elected?" I simply said I would consult my
lawyer, and, if necessary, take counsel's opinion.</p>

<p>Of course there was a vote of thanks, and of course it was carried. When
I got home, my wife, who had declined to go, asked me how it had all
gone off. "My dear <span class="smcap">Maria</span>," was all I said; "you are quite right. A man
at my time of life ought never to start taking part in public affairs."

<p><i>I. M.</i> And for the Infantry, too? You
see, there might be jealousy if you didn't.</p>

<p><i>H. V. B.</i> Quite so. And there should be

Then of course we should have a version to
be played by the Navy, first in fine weather
and then in a storm.</p>

<p><i>I. M.</i> I think we ought to do as much.

played or sung in hospitals, railway stations,

<p><i>I. M.</i> It shall! But there must be one

<p><i>H. V. B.</i> May I venture to ask by whom

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>Writes a Baronitess, "How quaint and simple appear the affectations
of Miss <span class="smcap">Jane Austen's</span> heroines in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>,
especially now that one's mind is confused with the vagaries of the
newspaper-created but impossible 'New Woman.'" Rather different
days then, when girls addressed their mothers as "Ma'am," and
were afraid of getting their feet wet, which was unromantic, and
bread-and-butter romance was the fashion of those times. No
matter, these romantic young women knew how to dress, according
to the exquisite illustrations of <span class="smcap">Hugh Thomson</span>. What could be
expected but sentiment, when the young men also appeared so picturesquely
attired. This new edition of an old work is charmingly
got up and published by <span class="smcap">George Allan</span>. Turning from these very
early nineteenth century attractions, I find <i>A Battle and a Boy</i>
staring at me from a brilliant red binding. The colour suggests a
gory fight, but there is nothing martial about it, only a Tyrolean
peasant-boy in a pugilistic attitude with another boy. He is having
it out before starting on his battle of life, which, taking place in the
gay Tyrol, where things happen out-of-the-way, <span class="smcap">Blanche Willis
Howard</span> has made it more interesting than an every-day fight.</p>

<p>Most young women nowadays like to be here, there, and everywhere,
and so you will find them in the <i>Fifty-two Stories of Girl-life</i>,
by some of our best women writers, and edited by <span class="smcap">Alfred H. Miles</span>.
Messrs. <span class="smcap">Hutchinson</span> who, publish this work, might head their advertisement
with "Go for Miles&mdash;and you won't find anything better
than this." Other jokes on "miles" they may discover or invent
for themselves. These are mostly for our big girls, but the little
ones will find a gorgeously gay <i>Rosebud Annual</i> for 1895, quite
a prize-flower, exhibited by <span class="smcap">James Clark &amp; Co.</span>; whilst <i>Rosy Mite;
or, the Witch's Spell</i>, by <span class="smcap">Vera Petrowna Jelibrovsky</span>,&mdash;this is a
nice easy name to ask for!&mdash;is a most thrilling nursery tale of how a
little girl, who ought to be an arithmetician after being reduced to
the size of her little finger, is able to subtract much adventurous
interest from among the insects and the insect-world, and is full of
undivided wonders.
The illustrations, by

charmingly unconventional
life can be in
such circumstances.</p>

<p>So charming, after
long years of parting,
to come again on <i>Mr.
Micawber!</i> Of all
things, he has been
writing an account of
<i>The Life and Adventures
of Thomas Edison</i>
(<span class="smcap">Chatto and Windus</span>).
The book purports
to be the joint
work of <span class="smcap">W. K. L.
Dickson</span> and <span class="smcap">Antonia
Dickson</span>. But that is
only his modesty. The
literary style is unmistakable.
"Released
from the swaddling
clothes of error and superstition," no one but <i>Mr. M.</i> could have
written, "the inherent virility of man has reasserted itself, and to
the untrammelled vision and ripened energies of the scientist the
arcana of nature have been gradually disclosed." "<span class="smcap">Edison's</span> literary
proclivities," he adds, in a sentence that recalls struggles in the
house in Windsor Terrace, City Road, where <i>David Copperfield</i> was
a lodger, "were seriously hampered by the collapse of the family
fortunes, and the early necessity of gaining his own living. Despite
his paucity of years, and the practical claims which life had already
imposed, <span class="smcap">Edison</span> devoted every spare moment to the improvement of
his mind, and profited to the utmost by the wise and gentle tuition
of his mother." My Baronite can almost hear <i>Mr. Micawber's</i>
voice choked by a sob as he declaimed this last sentence. Fortunately
(or unfortunately) <i>Mr. Micawber</i> does not last long. After the first
chapter his hand is rarely seen, he probably, the God of Day
gone down upon him, having been carried to the King's Bench
prison. For the rest, the book is an admirable account of one of the
most marvellous lives the world has known. Much of it is told in
<span class="smcap">Edison's</span> own words, conveying simple records of magic achievements.
The book, luxuriously printed on thick glazed paper, is
adorned by innumerable sketches and portraits, illustrating the life
and work of the Wizard of the Nineteenth Century.</p>

<p>Florence is undoubtedly one of the best places in the world for studying
pictures. Resolve to visit the Pitti Palace. Now I shall see something
like a palace&mdash;the home of the <span class="smcap">Medici</span>, adorned with all the beauty
of architecture and sculpture which they loved so well! No monotonous,
painted barrack like Buckingham Palace, no shabby brick house like St.
James's. And now I shall see a collection of pictures worthily housed in
a magnificent building! No contemptible piece of architecture like our
National Gallery, where you fall over the staircase directly you go in
at the door, and where, when you have recovered yourself, you find three
staircases, facing you like the heads of Cerberus at another entrance,
and always go up the wrong one, and have to come down again and clamber
up another before you find what you want. Even then, if you seek the
watercolours of the greatest English landscape painter, you must go down
yet another staircase into the cellar.</p>

<p>Ascertain the position of the Pitti Palace, and stroll gently
towards it. There is plenty of time, for the daylight will last
another three hours. Cross the Ponte Vecchio, and reach a large
open space opposite a magnificent jail. Yes! Even the jails here
are magnificent! Continue strolling on until I arrive at the open
country. Ask the way to the Palace, and am told that it is about
two kilomètres back along the way I have come. Curious that I should
not have noticed it. Return, looking carefully right and left, but do
not see it anywhere, and again arrive opposite the jail. Ask a man I
meet how that prison calls itself. He informs me courteously that it
is the Palazzo Pitti. That! That dismal, monotonous, gloomy,
brown structure? Why, Buckingham Palace is a joy for ever compared
to it, and even Wormwood Scrubbs Prison reveals unsuspected
charms! Would like to sit down to recover from the shock, but as
one is more likely to find a public seat in a London square than in an
Italian piazza, this is impossible. Therefore, totter to the great
central entrance. Perhaps the grand staircase leading to the galleries
may be as attractive as the exterior is
forbidding.</p>

<p>Discover that the entrance to the galleries is by a small side door,
where I leave my walking-stick, and climb a narrow, steep staircase.
Then climb a narrower and steeper staircase, and finally reach a
staircase so steep and narrow that it might more accurately be called a
ladder. Begin to think I have mistaken the way. Perhaps I shall find
myself in the attics of the Palace, and be arrested as an anarchist.
Have left my stick below, and have not even a passport with which to
protect myself. Step cautiously up the first rounds of the ladder, when
suddenly a large body completely fills the space above, and comes slowly
down. It is impossible to go on; it is impossible to remain where I am.
Must therefore go down to the least narrow staircase, and wait till the
obstruction has passed. Do so. Awful pause....</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
